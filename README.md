## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.Provide general information about your project here.
- The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia saved as Train.csv.
- We have built a Linear, Ridge and Lasso regression models for the above dataset.

## Conclusions
Ridge and Lasso give us r2 values of 95% and 87% on train and test sets respectively.
Top significant variables:
Roof material
MSZoning
Ground living Area
Type 1 finished basement square feet
1st floor square feet
